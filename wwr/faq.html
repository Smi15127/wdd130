            <h3 class="safety-head">Is white water rafting safe? I donâ€™t even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>

            <p class="safety-body">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed risk. To help ensure your safety, 
                our guides are all certified in wilderness survival first aid and all start with at least 3 years of 
                rafting experience. The most common injuries are in fact sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vests or a 
                personal flotation device (PFD). This enables many non-swimmers to go on rafting trips and have a 
                great time.Your guide will give you an in-depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins, 
                explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.
                </p>

            <h3 class="trip-head">What is included in the trip?</h3>

            <p class="items-body">The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be

                Nylon Pants or Sarong.

                bring polypropylene long underwear tops and bottoms.

                Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice 
                (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). 
                Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom.
